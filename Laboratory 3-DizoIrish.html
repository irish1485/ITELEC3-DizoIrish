    Internet and the World Wide Web

  <p>
    Many people use the terms <b style= "color:tomato">Internet</b> and
    the <b style= "color:tomato">World Wide Web</b> interchangeable,
but in fact, the two terms are not synonymous. 
      The Internet and the Web are two separated but related things.
    <p>The <b style= "color:tomato">Internet</b> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It
connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which
any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both
connected to the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of
languages called <em>"Protocols".</em>
  </p>
   The <b style= "color:tomato">World Wide Web</b>  or simply <em>"Web"</em>, is a way of accessing information over
the medium of the internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the internet. 
    The Web uses the <b style= "color:tomato">HTTP protocol</b>, only one of the languages
spoken over the internet, to transmit data.
